Hi everybody, I'm Dan Wojtowicz. I am a third year co-terminal CS student. My
interests include organizing, watching, and competing in e-sports competitions
(read: video game tournaments), especially Super Smash Bros. Melee and League of
Legends. I also enjoy creating my own games and writing software that helps me
achieve my goals in whatever phase of life I am in.
