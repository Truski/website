I am a junior Computer Science student at Illinois Institute of Technology,
currently pursuing a co-terminal Bachelor's and Master's degree. In the field of
Computer Science, I am interested in video game development and systems
architectures. From a young age I wondered how different systems were designed
and interacted with each other, so my goals involve understanding these systems
to be able to improve upon them with my own ideas.

My first experience programming a computer occurred when I was about ten years
old. At a family gathering, my cousin showed me some cool new things she had
learned in her 8th grade Web Design class. It was then that I wrote my first
HTML page using the standards of that era. Our lessons stopped there,
unfortunately, and for many years I was writing pages strictly with HTML and no
other technologies like CSS, JavaScript, or back-end languages. My sites were
ugly, but they did the job of displaying content. Since then I have learned a
lot more about Web Design, but through this class I hope to improve my skills
and standardize my web design style.
