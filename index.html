  <h1>Dan Wojtowicz</h1>
  <p>
    Hi everybody, I'm Dan Wojtowicz. I am a third year co-terminal CS student.
    My interests include organizing, watching, and competing in e-sports
    competitions (read: video game tournaments), especially Super Smash Bros.
    Melee and League of Legends. I also enjoy creating my own games and writing
    software that helps me achieve my goals in whatever phase of life I am in.
