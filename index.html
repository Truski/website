  <h1>Dan Wojtowicz</h1>
  <p>
    I am a junior Computer Science student at Illinois Institute of Technology,
    currently pursuing co-terminal Bachelor's and Master's degrees. In the field
    of Computer Science, I am interested in video game development and system
    architectures. Ever since I could remember, I have wondered how different
    computer systems were designed and interacted with each other, so some of my
    goals include understanding these systems to be able to improve upon them
    with my own ideas.

    My first experience programming a computer occurred when I was about ten
    years old. At a family gathering, my cousin showed me some cool new things
    she had learned in her 8th grade Web Design class. It was then that I wrote
    my first HTML page using the standards of that era. Our lessons stopped
    there, unfortunately, and for many years I was writing pages strictly with
    HTML and no other technologies like CSS, JavaScript, or back-end languages.
    My sites were ugly, but they did the job of displaying content. Since then I
    have learned a lot more about web design, but through this class I hope to
    improve my skills and standardize my web design style.

    A hobby of mine is organizing and competing in electronic sports like League
    of Legends. In high school I created a gaming club focused around Super
    Smash Bros. Melee, a simple but very technically-deep game. The club grew
    quickly, as did our events. I used my abilities in web design to create a
    website for the club and wrote applications that streamlined club processes.
    In addition to these things, I created marketing materials and graphics for
    each tournament live stream. The work so far has culminated into a massive
    event we held in the summer of 2017, where I combined my experience of TOing
    (tournament organizing) with programming to create an event that imitated
    professional gaming tournaments like EVO.

    In my free time, I do freelance work, usually building websites or building
    and fixing computers. During the summer of 2017 I had an internship position
    at Carl Buddig &amp; Company; I spent my time there updating their existing
    code to the latest .NET version and developing new features in their
    internal knowledge base. At that job I learned to love high level languages
    like Visual Basic and all-you-can-eat development environments like Visual
    Studio.

    In the programming world, I see myself as a jack of many trades. If there is
    a technology I'm interested in, I at least want to understand the basics.
    One area where I am invested in learning the deep-level internals, however,
    is game development. So far I have been using frameworks like LibGDX or
    manipulating the DOM to create games, but I would like to dig deeper and
    create my own game engine. I mainly am interested in creating competitive
    games, such as the ones I play and create tournaments for. I look forward to
    a career in a game development studio or even my own gaming company.
